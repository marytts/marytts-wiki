I created a [mirror repository of MaryTTS](https://github.com/mbarnig/MaryTTS-6) to build the latest version 6 with some changes. To clone the branch 6.x in a Docker container Ubuntu-jdk8 I use the command   
 
`git clone -b 6.x https://github.com/mbarnig/MaryTTS-6.git`.

To build the project I install Maven with `apt-get install maven`.
