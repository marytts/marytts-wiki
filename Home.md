1. Check in the  [new list of issues on github](https://github.com/marytts/marytts/issues?state=open) as well as the [old list of known bugs on TRAC](http://mary.opendfki.de/query?group=status&milestone=4.0) whether the bug has been reported already;

2. If you cannot find it, create a  new issue on github containing the following information:
  * operating system and java version used;
  * what to do to reproduce the error;
  * expected behaviour;
  * detailed log files, i.e. an excerpt of MARY TTS/log/server.log containing the error episode. 

3. Discuss the problem on the [MARY user mailing list](http://www.dfki.de/mailman/listinfo/mary-users).
You can search past messages on the Mary-users or the Mary-developers lists, please have a look to the Mailing List section in [the old TRAC page](https://mary.opendfki.de/trac/)
